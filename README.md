WordLookup
==========

This repository contains a forked version of [`WordLookup`, an Android app originally written by Yu Chen Hou.](https://github.com/icechen1/WordLookup) I forked it because I use this app quite a lot every day and was wondering if there's any better way to deal with different variations of spelling for words.
